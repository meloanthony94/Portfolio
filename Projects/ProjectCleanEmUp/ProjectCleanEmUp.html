		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title">Game Mechanics</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p5>Collection</p5></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>At the heart of "Project Clean 'Em Up," the collection mechanic stands as the driving force of gameplay, intertwining strategy, risk, and reward. As players accompany Rosalia and her trusty robot on their mission to cleanse the oceans, their ability to collect marine debris takes center stage.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Collect for Progress</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>The Oceanic Harvesting mechanic serves as the core gameplay element, directly impacting progress and scores. Collecting marine debris is the primary objective, reflecting the game's core theme of environmental conservation.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Score Multiplier</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>Players are incentivized to collect as much debris as possible in one go. The score system is designed to reward larger collections with higher multipliers, encouraging players to strategize and plan their collection routes for maximum efficiency.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Proximity Indicators</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>An intuitive proximity indicator system guides players during collection. Green indicators signify safe collection proximity, while red indicates potential departure from the collection zone. Players must maintain proximity to maximize their haul.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Perimeter Drawing</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>To successfully collect debris, players draw a perimeter around the scattered items while staying within the designated proximity range. This dynamic mechanic adds an element of skillful coordination and timing, enhancing the gameplay experience.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Strategic Decision-Making</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>Choosing when to initiate a collection run and how to efficiently draw perimeters becomes paramount. Players must weigh the risks of pushing their boundaries for a larger collection versus ensuring a secure gathering process.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p6>Packaging and Collection</p6></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>Once a successful perimeter is drawn, the collected debris is skillfully packaged and sent to the surface. Rosalia, stationed above in her dedicated collection area, receives the packaged debris, further enhancing the immersive nature of the mechanic.</p3>

		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body"> 
			<p3>Drawing inspiration from classic shoot 'em ups such as Cotton and Sky Force, and iconic side-scrolling shooters like Mega Man, the blasting mechanic in "Project Clean 'Em Up" delivers a thrilling and dynamic combat experience. Players are equipped with two distinct non lethal blasting modes that bring their environmental heroics to life. The first, the normal blast, provides swift and dependable shooting. For those seeking an extra edge, the charged blast presents a formidable option more potent and quicker, yet demanding patience as it charges. Upgrades take center stage as players can enhance the properties of their blasts, fortifying both damage potential and projectile speed.</p3>

Scattered more sparingly across each level, these Unique Treasures are a challenge to locate, rewarding players with knowledge, lore, and a sense of accomplishment akin to uncovering hidden gems.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p5>Uncommon</p5></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>The game's seascape is punctuated by Uncommon collectibles—large or peculiar marine debris that beckon to be cleaned up. Representing a higher point value, these relics extend an invitation to players to venture beyond the ordinary, promising greater rewards for their diligent pursuit of the unusual. In line with the game's theme, their unique nature is a testament to the beauty that can emerge from the cleanup effort.</p3>
		</div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-title"><p5>Common</p5></div>
		<div class="project-breakdown-section-body">
			<p3>Embodying the most prevalent forms of marine garbage like platic bottles and straws, Common collectibles serve as a testament to the pervasive challenges of ocean pollution. This category, while frequent, remains no less significant; players who dedicate themselves to eradicating these commonplace items contribute to the larger mission of environmental restoration while building up their multipliers.</p3>

			<p3>Each type of collectible fuels the system of upgrades, directly influencing gameplay and enhancing the player's experience. The uniqueness of each type translates into different upgrade avenues. From boosting the efficiency of abilities using Common and Uncommon Relics to unlocking a new cosmetic skin with Unique Treasures.</p3>
			<p3>In "Project Clean 'Em Up," the collectibles are weaved seamlessly into the game's narrative and its commitment to ocean conservation. As players gather marine treasures, they simultaneously fuel their journey of empowerment, education, and responsibility, aligning every discovery with the game's core purpose.</p3>
